    <h1>Where I was Born & Living</h1>
    <h2> Virginia</h2>
        <pre> I was born in Virginia, Plymouth Hospital. 04/19/03 is when is was born, April 19, 2003. My father was there at my birth and for a time we all was living 
in Virginia my mother, my father, and me all until my mother was told to be stationed somewhere else.(<em>She was in the military</em>) For the time being
i was only about two to three years old, so much of what about the place i was born at and everything that happened i don't remember much.</pre>
             <h2>Times and where i was living</h2>
            <pre>After my mother was stationed somewhere else for a time i stayes with my father. My father and I went to my brother so, that I could see him and for a brief time I lived with him in Nebraska. 
Living in the cold, where i can wake up to snow everyday and be so happy to see it made my world as a little kid was one of the best things in the world to me. Than after a while i had to go with my mother. 
Her and I went to multiple locations California, Georgia, Tampa, etc.  We went to Georgia after we left Nebraska cause my mother wanted to spend some time there. But afterwards we moved to California. 
In California, she lived on the base and I was living with my auntie Shawen, that lived close to the base from where my mother worked at and through those times was when i saw so much stuff and lived in a 
beautiful home. One day hope to get back there and experience more now that I am older than I was at that time. Of course we didn't get to stay cause after about two months they restationed her to another location 
and now that was in Florida, Tampa. There i lived with her and my other two sisters that was older than me. For a time we lived there for a while. More than the time i spent i Virginia, California, and Georgia all 
total up. Tampa is where i remember the most of my childhood and is the time where i spent most of my life until we moved down to Vero Beach and now staying at the moment until we move back to Georgia.</pre>
